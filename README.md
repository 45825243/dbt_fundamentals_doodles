# dbt_fundamentals_doodles
## Hi there! Today is my birthday!! What a great day to give a new born to my github account! 
I'll use this repo as a draft. Need to remember a lot of things.
For now I'm in a middle of a course 'dbt foundation' and I want to use it to remeber how github works.
## Set up a github
Since I have VS Code installed, I open it and create a new project. I choose the folder with a screenshot of my corrent course status.
I initiate git repository using command `git init` . 

After that I `git status` to check what is going on and receive a message "On branch master, no commits yet".. What a surprise. /

`git branch` showed "master" so I decided to create a "main" branch because I see main branch on the site. Let's try with `git checkout -b main`. Success!

Let's try to download a picture to github. Use `git add progress.png` and then `git commit -m "Picture of dbt course progress added"` and then `git push origin main` .. And thennn **error** . Am I dumb?

Yep I forgot to do `git pull original main` soo I fixed it. Not sure so need to do it once again.
